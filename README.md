## Hi there 👋

<!--# ☁️ Cloud & Security Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands on learning in **Cloud Computing**, with a clear and intentional progression toward **Cloud Security**.

I am currently focused on building **strong cloud foundations through AWS Cloud Practitioner preparation**, with the belief that a deep understanding of cloud services, architectures, and responsibilities is essential before specializing in security.

This repository serves as a **living record of my growth**, capturing practical labs, configurations, mistakes, and lessons learned as I develop cloud knowledge with a security mindset.
