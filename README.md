## Hi there 👋

I am Joshua, a learner exploring **Cloud Computing** with a focus on
**AWS Cloud**. I am preparing for the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification,
while building a solid foundation in cloud concepts before moving fully
into **Cloud Security**.

I believe you must clearly understand how the cloud works services, responsibilities,
and architectures before you can secure it properly. This GitHub is where I document
my learning journey, share projects, and explain cloud concepts in my own way as I grow.

I am open to learning, collaboration, and helpful feedback. I enjoy drinking tea and doing research on the tech and aviation industries.
