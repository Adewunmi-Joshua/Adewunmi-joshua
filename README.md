## Hi there 👋

I am Joshua, a learner exploring **Cloud Computing** with a strong focus on
**AWS Cloud**. I am currently preparing for the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification,
while intentionally building a solid foundation in cloud concepts before moving fully
into **Cloud Security**.

I believe you must clearly understand how the cloud works services, responsibilities,
and architectures—before you can secure it properly. This GitHub is where I document
my learning journey, share projects, and explain cloud concepts in my own way as I grow.

I’m open to learning, collaboration, and helpful feedback.
